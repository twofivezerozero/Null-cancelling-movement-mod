# null cancelling movement
## What?
This mod changes Minecraft's vanilla keyboard input behavior so that when opposite movement keys on the same axis are pressed simultaneously (forward + backward, or left + right), the mod resolves the conflict by using the last pressed direction. It implements a behavior similar to "Null cancelling movement scripts" from source games, “SOCD” and “Snap Tap”

Here's sort of a showcase of what it does. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Bj7pMIqHQ
## Why?
Most players won't ever think about or need a mod like this, it is purely up to personal preference. Players that are used to null-movement might prefer to have consistency across games.
